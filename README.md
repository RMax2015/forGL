**Want to learn computer programming? forGL can help you.**

**Prior experience with computer programming or even knowing English is not needed. If you can use a Dictionary you are ready to program. Knowing how to use a Calculator may help but is not required.**

**forGL uses ideas from:**

**Natural Language: Ideas of Verbs, Nouns and Punctuation.** Use of a Dictionary of words to support programming in a single or a mix of Natural Languages. You may use words from multiple languages within a single Verb definition.

**Mathematics as a Language: Ideas of various operations and functions such as: add, subtract, sin, cos ...**

**Programming Language(s): Reserved key words or symbols such as: =, !=, if, then, while ...**

**Declarative key words such as: from, into, show, repeat ...**


**WARNING:**

**The forGL application is a rough prototype with features that are incomplete, have significant defects (bugs) or even missing entirely.**

**Most of the forGL application is written in Haxe** with output to: C++, C#, Java, Python and JavaScript.

Test platforms used: 

Laptops running Windows 7 and 10.

**Languages used to implement forGL tested: C++, Java, Python, (all working well)**
**C# (no color or cursor positioning), **
JavaScript (not really working).

Very incomplete testing on old Android phone with incomplete JavaScript / HTML / JavaScript Web Worker (from Haxe).

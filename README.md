# forGL
This is an application to allow anyone to do computer programming.

Prior experience with computer programming or (in the future) even knowing English is not needed. If you can use a Dictionary you are ready to program. Knowing how to use a Calculator application may help but is not required.

 "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."

The forGL project (imitates) uses ideas from:

Natural Language: Ideas of Verbs, Nouns and Punctuation (if available). Use of a Dictionary of words to support programming in a single or a mix of Natural Languages. You may use words from multiple languages within a single Verb definition.

Mathematics as a Language: Ideas of various operations and functions such as: add, subtract, sin, cos ...

Programming Language(s): Reserved key words or symbols such as: =, !=, if, then, while ...

4GL style declarative key words such as: from, into, show, repeat ...


WARNING:

The forGL application is a rough prototype with features that are incomplete, have significant defects (bugs) or even missing entirely.

Most of the forGL application is written in Haxe with output to: C++, C#, Java, Python and JavaScript.

Test platforms used: 

Laptops running Windows 7 and 10.

Languages used to implement forGL tested: C++ (best for now), C# (no color or cursor positioning), Java, Python, JavaScript (not really working).

Very incomplete testing on old Android phone with incomplete JavaScript / HTML / JavaScript Web Worker (from Haxe).

Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin cause I never ever
Saw so much
---
And I can't recall any code at all
                       ----

Baby this shows another way.
          ----------------- 

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be code?
                             ----
Straight from my mind
                 ----

Oh, tell me why can't this be code?
                              ----
I tell myself
Hey not just fools rush in and only time will tell
    --------
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run code to win and so this can
                  ----            -----------
be much more than just fine.
---------------------------

Hey
No I can't recall any code at all
                      ----
Oh baby this shows another way.
             -----------------
Woo
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be code?
                             ----
You want it straight from my mind
                          -------

Oh tell me why can't this be code?
                             ----
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be code?
                             ----
Straight from my mind
                 ----

Oh, tell me why can't this be code?
                              ----
Baby why can't this be code?
                       ----
Got to know why can't this be code?
                              ----
I wanna know why can't this be code?
                               ----

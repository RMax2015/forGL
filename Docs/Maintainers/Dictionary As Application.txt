Dictionary As Application


This is an extension to the Verb  Export As Code  feature.

Idea is to Export As Code the entire Dictionary.

All Verbs become Procedures in the Simplified Programming Language 
and then whatever is correct in the final target language.

All Nouns become Global Data items.

All Local Nouns become local variables within the containing Procedure (original Verb).


Also a really simple menu that just has 1 entry for each Verb Name (now Procedure Name).

May also provide a CLI argument interface to allow Automated running.
	Cool idea:
Menu is converted to something like COM IUnknown (JSON implementation perhaps)
where individual interfaces can be discovered at runtime simply and by code.
Interfaces would be really simple similar to IDL (or JSON or GRPC or ?) without extra stuff.

Later this Cool idea could be expanded to like a file based DLL approach that is OS neutral.

		AND / OR

User could select the Procedure to run.
If Procedure needs some input data then User provides that as well.

		Simple yet could be quite useful because:

Code runs at Compiled or JIT Compiled or Efficient Interpreter speed
instead of forGL Interpreter speed.

Sometimes you have already defined the Solution 
and you do NOT want extra flexability and complexity of the forGL Interpreter.

Sometimes you want to do A / B testing and this way it is easy to select either.

Sometime you want to run just a part of the Solution. Testing use or ???

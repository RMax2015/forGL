forGL  as an Application READ ME

Here are different ways you can run forGL.

These different ways are available so you do not need to install any extra software.

Each of these ways use the same Dictionary file style as in the
Dictionaries  directory. 

You can choose any combination of files from these directories:

Browser   Not ready for ordinary use! NEEDS DEBUGGING ! ! !

Java      at least Java 6 installed, Java 8 or later is recommended

Python    Python 3.6 or later installed


If you are using Windows :
------------------------

If you want to use the Java or Python applications you also need to get
ansicon.exe 

The version of  ansicon.exe  I use can be found at :
http://adoxa.altervista.org/ansicon/

click on the link labeled :
ANSICON v1.89

Easier to download both DLL files and ansicon.exe and put them in same directory you created.

and set the Windows text Code Page to UTF8
chcp 65001

    NOTE :
Testing was done on Windows 7 and 10.
Not sure about how good is Windows support for UTF8 on older versions of Windows.


Thanks for trying forGL !

forGL  Browser  READ  ME

April 2019

This directory holds incomplete and buggy Web files that work with forGL.

HTML  Needs serious debugging

After HTML is working, it needs to be moved to the src/js subdirectory

I tried to get the Dictionary to load into the page to view only but not working yet.


I think we can agree my HTML skills are lacking.

Hope this helps!
